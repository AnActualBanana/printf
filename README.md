# Project 0x12: C - printf
### A project by Holberton School students in Tulsa, OK

## About the Project:
The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality of the C standard
libraries `printf` function in our user defined function `_printf`. Our `_printf`
produces an output to stdout according to a format specified in a string
according to a directive (%) and C programming conversion specifiers: C, S, %
which are defined by the C programming language.

## Why is this project useful?
This project will give you insight into the implementation of `printf` and how
it's functionality can be executed when you are not allowed to use the standard
library. This project would be most useful for students who are also learning how
to code and are immersing themselves in the beauty of the C programming language.
This project would also help anyone preparing for an interview that would include
a technical question about creating their own version of a C standard library function.
Additionally, this project is useful to anyone curious about the curriculum at
Holberton School and how students apply what they've learned.

## Getting Started
This project only contains code that helps our user defined function `_printf`
func. In order to use our function you will simply need to clone or fork this
repository to your local machine and implement in your code the same way you would
any other user defined function. ***Note:*** *we do not recommend using this
function in place of the more powerful and more accurate `printf`.*

This project would be of great use to someone who would like to get started
implementing their own `printf` and would like more practice coding and understanding
the C programming language. We welcome contributions, suggestions, and tips on
how to improve our codes implementation and we will review all pull requests for
the code's fucntionality and accuracy.

## Contact Us
The two main contributors to this project are Logan McClain and Jessica Loyd,
both members of Cohort 17 at Holberton School. Logan and Jessica will maintain
the code in this project on as needed basis per the requirements of the course
for this project. They can be reached by email at:

Thank you for visiting and getting acquaint with a project that taught us a lot
about the C programming language, the power of `printf`, working together on
building a program, and collaborating using GitHub.
