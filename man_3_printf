.TH _printf 3 "March 2022" "Version 1.0"

.SH NAME
_printf - our own version of the standard library function printf

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "main.h"

int _print(const char *format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() produces an an output to stdout, the standard output
stream, according to the format given to the function in the function's
arguments. The format string controls the appearance of the output based on one
or more directives that it includes. The function is a variadic function and as
such accepts a variable number of arguments to be displayed as long as there are
the equivalent amount of directives in the format string. The format string
contains characters that are directly output to stdout unless preceded by a %.
When a % is found in the format string the character following it specifies a
conversion that needs to be made according to the corresponding arguments which
follow the function's format string. The function successfully converts the
arguments that are characters, strings and the symbol %, when given as a
directive in the format string, a % followed by c, s, or % respectively.

The function returns -1 for error.

.SH OPTIONS
this function does not use any options.

.SH BUGS
The function may not work in all conversion cases for characters, and strings.
The function also does not successfully convert integers specified by the d and
i directive like the standard library's printf function.
